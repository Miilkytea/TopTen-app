##Top Ten App

Top Ten App is a place where users can make endless lists of their top ten favorite things. Books, movies, music, foods, cars, you name it. You can share your favorite lists with friends. You can even make a  top ten list of your favorite Top Ten lists.

##MVP
Users login and make personlized lists. They can share lists on social media. They can add items to these lists with images descriptions. 

##Icebox
Implement a different design for the site, an API, and more user personalization for their profiles.

###Technologies 

This app was created with HTML, CSS and Ruby using a Rails framework. Hosted by Heroku and version control by Git. It was typed on a Macintosh Computer.

###Unsolved Problems

The site is not quite responsive and still needs a bunch more styling and polishing. A new user can sign in but the site only registers the current user, not by ID's. The app needs authentication for its password protected content and the ability to share lists with friends and family through social media. 

I would like to add JQuery to the app to make it even more fun and interactive, and stylized. Also as the title of the app states, the lists need to be limited to ten items per list.
